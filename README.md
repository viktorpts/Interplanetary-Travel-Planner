# Interplanetary-Travel-Planner

Orbital map view for Kerbal Space Program. Includes planet position at chosen epoch and progress after a set ammount of time. Starting body and deltaV can be specified, as well as trip time and the position of all celestial bodies and the ship will be plotted on the map. Currently uses a hardcoded database of orbital parameters for the planets, but since celestial bodies are objects loaded at runtime, it can be made to operate with a file database. If real data is entered for existing planets or satellites, the model will still work (all calculations are based on actual orbital mechanics, using the Newtonian method). Orbital inclination is not supported, since the view can't be rotated, but it's taken into account in the calculations, though it'll take some effort to fully implement. Planetary satellites feature is not fully implemented and can't be accessed, just some code is available.
